[Verse 1]
Wise man call me the crazy
Loving foolishly
Dream about you all the time
Every night I fall asleep
Chasing and dreaming
Looking for your eyes Daisy

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the foolish Gatsby who's found drown in love
Can't you see my heart burning right through my hands?
'Cause your smile lifts me above and beyond the blue sky
In the darkest moments here I still can see your eyes

[Chorus]
Love you to the moon and back
I can let you know this fact
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freaking missing you
Aim for the moon yet so far (so far)
I can't land among the stars (stars)
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freaking missing you (I'm so freaking missing you)

[Verse 2]
I never let my love get so close (to, be, doo, wah)
To you 'cause it hurts swear to God I wish I could (no, no, no)
'Cause I'm the foolish Gatsby who's found drown in love
(Found drown in love) to, be, doo, wah
Can't you see my heart burning right through my hands?
Da, de, bah, bah (whoa)
[Bridge]
'Cause your smile lifts me above and beyond the blue sky
To, be, doo, doo, doo
In the darkest moments here still can see your eyes
Love you to the moon and back
I can't let you know this fact

[Chorus]
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freaking missing you
Aim for the moon yet so far (so far)
I can't land among the stars (stars)
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freaking missing you (I'm so freaking missing you)

Love you to the moon and back
I can let you know this fact
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freaking missing you (I'm so freaking missing you)
Aim for the moon yet so far
I can land among the stars
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freaking missing you
